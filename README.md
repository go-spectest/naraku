# naraku (奈落) - API collection for testing go-spectest/spectest
"Naraku" is a repository created to assess the quality of End-to-End (E2E) tests using [go-spectest/spectest](https://github.com/go-spectest/naraku). Spectest is an E2E testing framework, and to confirm its ease of use, it is essential to create test cases for APIs.

I chose to build APIs to test a wide range of API types.

## The origin of the name
The name "Naraku" was borrowed from a character in the series InuYaSha. Naraku is a being formed by the accumulation of numerous demons around a human. The inspiration for the name comes from the way multiple APIs gather in the spectest framework. Naraku is a half-demon with excellent defensive abilities. I also hope that these characteristics will manifest in spectest.
